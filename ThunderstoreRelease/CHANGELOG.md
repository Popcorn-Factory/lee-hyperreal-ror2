# Lee: Hyperreal - A Character Mod for Risk of Rain 2
## Changelog
- 1.1.0
    - Updated Dependencies to support SotS
        - Unfortunately, controller players will not be able to use orbs as we have removed the dependency on ExtraSkillSlots until further notice.
    - Removed dependency on R2API.Sound, was not being used.
    - Fixed an edge case where Hypermatrix Aerial Attacks play the particle stream infinitely due to Hypermatrix ending while in an aerial dive.
	- Fixed the pod from blowing out your eyes on some maps.
	- P2 now behaves more closely to source material
	    - 3 -> 5 hits 
        - 125% -> 70% damage
- 1.0.4
    - Fixed the pod from not being registered on the Network properly.
    - Fixed an issue regarding client's getting spawned in without a pod, causing the server and clients to desync from what would be expected.
    - Fixed the wrong dependency from being compiled in the mod, should now work with the suggest mods in the Thunderstore manifest.
    - Changed the UI Instantiation to use Find when navigating the RoR HUD, instead of indexes. Should be more compatible with mods that modify the UI.
    - Changed the values on the following moves:
        - End of Time cooldown -> 4s to 6s per stack. (Total 60s for 10 stacks)
        - End of Time damage -> 5000% to 6500%
        - End of Time enemy freeze duration -> 8s to 6.9s (This should allow the enemies to start moving 0.2s after the move has ended.)
