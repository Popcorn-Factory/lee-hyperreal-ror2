# Lee: Hyperreal - A Character Mod for Risk of Rain 2
Lee: Hyperreal is a highly technical, mobile-grounded survivor that relies on parries and resource management to cut through hoards of enemies. Utilizing your damage and timed invincibility is crucial to success.

- Setup your Orbs to do 4 times the damage by performing 3-pings.
- Any successful parry resets the Armament Barrage combo chain, allowing you to parry consistently and in succession.
- Snipe stance is a powerful tool in your arsenal, but in return leaves you vulnerable as you are locked in place.
- End of Time can decimate enemies within a huge radius, but be mindful of its long cooldown.

Network Compatible! (Unless otherwise found not to be, but it should work pretty well.)

## Known Issues
- In networked situations, if you emote, everyone playing Lee will have their weapons removed, this does not affect how he functions, purely visual.
- In very rare cases, Lee: Hyperreal can move even after dying. This is usually the case in networked situations where you perform a move and die in the same frame.
- When enemies are frozen during an ultimate, Some enemies may have bugged animators and their legs may go up into their torso, this effect is temporary and mostly just looks goofy that's all.
