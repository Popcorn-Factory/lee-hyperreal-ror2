# Lee: Hyperreal - A Character Mod for Risk of Rain 2
Lee: Hyperreal is a highly technical, mobile-grounded survivor that relies on parries and resource management to cut through hoards of enemies. Utilizing your damage and timed invincibility is crucial to success.

- Setup your Orbs to do 4 times the damage by performing 3-pings.
- Any successful parry resets the Armament Barrage combo chain, allowing you to parry consistently and in succession.
- Snipe stance is a powerful tool in your arsenal, but in return leaves you vulnerable as you are locked in place.
- End of Time can decimate enemies within a huge radius, but be mindful of its long cooldown.

Network Compatible! (Unless otherwise found not to be, but it should work pretty well.)

## Known Issues
- Controller players have no way to currently trigger orbs. 
- Sometimes the Ultimate Icon overlays on top of each other in the corner.
- Usually in networking situations, emotes will still play while their weapons are floating around them.
- AI controlled Lee: Hyperreals may spam Ultimate, stealing the camera, but only for the person hosting the game. 
- In very rare cases, Lee: Hyperreal can move even after dying.
- Camera locks up if you change the settings to not move the camera while in snipe stance
- When enemies are frozen during an ultimate, Golems may have bugged animators and their legs may go up into their torso, this effect is temporary and mostly just looks goofy that's all.
